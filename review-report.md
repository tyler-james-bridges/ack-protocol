# Code Review Report

**Score:** 85/100

## Summary

This change adds a Husky pre-push hook for format checking and updates documentation tables for better alignment. The changes are low-risk documentation and tooling improvements with no functional code changes.

## Issues

### 🟡 Pre-push hook may fail in CI/CD environments

**Severity:** medium | **File:** `.husky/pre-push` | **Line:** 3

The pre-push hook runs `npx prettier --check .` which could fail in automated environments where prettier isn't installed or in monorepos where the hook runs from unexpected directories. This could block legitimate pushes in deployment pipelines.

**Suggestion:**
Add error handling to check if prettier is available and consider using `npm run format:check` instead of direct npx calls to respect package.json scripts

### 🟢 Inconsistent method signature documentation

**Severity:** low | **File:** `README.md` | **Line:** 63

The kudos method is documented with different parameter signatures in README.md vs docs/sdk-reference.md. README shows `{ category?, message?, fromAgentId? }` while SDK reference shows `{ category?, message?, isReview?, value? }` which could confuse developers.

**Suggestion:**
Ensure method signatures are consistent across all documentation or clearly indicate which parameters are available in different contexts

## Recommendations

- Consider making the pre-push hook more robust by checking for prettier availability before running
- Standardize method signature documentation across README and SDK reference docs
